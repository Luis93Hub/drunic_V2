      },
      {
        "question": "Do you adapt to the technology stack my project needs?",

        "question": "How do you choose the right technology for my project?",
        "answer": "We analyze your business needs, scalability expectations, and long-term plans. Based on this evaluation, we recommend the most efficient technology, whether that’s Drupal for content-heavy platforms, Next.js for high-performance web apps, or custom desktop solutions using C#."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you work with a specific technology I prefer?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. If you already have a preferred tech stack—such as Drupal, Next.js, or C#—we can align your project with that stack as long as it supports the functionality and performance your project requires."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer custom-built software in addition to websites?",
        "answer": "Yes. Besides CMS and web platforms, we build fully customized software solutions, including desktop applications in C#. We design each solution to fit your workflow, industry, and operational needs."
